# Risk of unsustainable debt Prediction
In this machine learning project, multiple classification models we're taught to predict the risk of unsustainable debt with scikit-learn. 

The applied algorithms were LogisticRegression, SVC, MLPClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB, ComplementNB, KNeighborsClassifier.
